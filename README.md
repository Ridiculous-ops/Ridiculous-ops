- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ridiculous-ops
- 👀 I’m interested in high-performance computing, parallel algorithms, and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CUDA programming and optimizing convolution algorithms with ARM NEON and Winograd.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source HPC projects, optimization techniques, and machine learning model acceleration.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once optimized a sorting algorithm so well it ran faster than the disk I/O!
